# ExpenseTracker
It has two model one is category and another is expense. for both i created two different controller where category controller is
normal views with EF and Expanse controller if slightly different. 

# ExpenseController
The controller has been designed in a way the user can create and edit in a same form based on Id.
For this i used bootstrap Modal and Jquary Ajax to load and working with the data.

# Navbar
i have attached a navbar where you can redirect to the List.

# FutureDate
in here i stopped using future date option. a user cannot choose future date.

# dataInRange
i have added datepicker where you can enter the range. and the data will be filtered.

i have included the database link. 
If you have any Query then let me know at md.sayemhossain.25@gmail.com
